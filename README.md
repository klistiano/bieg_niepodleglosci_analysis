# 3 Poznański Bieg Niepodległości
Hey. It's my first analysis and first working python code. ;)

In 3 Poznański Bieg Niepodległości took part 22542 participants. 
I decided to analyse this race and answer a few basic questions:

> What is the average, minimal, maximal finish time for the participants?

> Did the participants finish times follow a normal distribution? 

> What age group was most popular?

> What are differences between males and females results?
